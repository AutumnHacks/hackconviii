# Welcome to the GitHub Scavenger Hunt 👋 🕵️‍♀️

Here you'll find everything you need to participate in the GitHub Education Scavenger Hunt. Once you've completed each of the tasks, create an Issue on this repository using the `Scavenger Hunt` template to describe each task. We'll verify the tasks are completed and someone from the GitHub Education team will **leave a comment with your final instructions**. Only when this final task is complete will you be entered into the drawing for GitHub swag ✨

1. Complete all tasks in the scavenger hunt
2. Create an Issue verifying you’ve completed all of the steps
3. Follow the instructions given to you by the GitHub team before `x o'clock`

## 🗺 Tasks

All eleven tasks must be complete to move onto the final stage! Be sure to expand each task for details on how to verify the task has been completed. Questions? Create an Issue with the tag "Question" and we'll help yah out.

<summary>Say hello 👋</summary>
  
 * Conferences are always more fun when you run into old friends and connections 👯‍♀️ Scan the list of attendees and send a quick hello to each name you recognize on the list. No names you recognize? We'll be your friend! Say hi to @elisemoe or @juanpflores. Complete this task by checking the box to say you've reconnected with someone at HackCon VIII.

<summary>Make new friends 👯‍♀️</summary>
  
 * Now that we've done some catching up, let's make a new friend. Choose one name (at random or someone you've wanted to connect with) and introduce yourself. Let them know why you love your student community and ask a question about theirs :) To complete this task you'll need to send us a screenshot of your intro. No need to include their response!

<summary>Build your alter ego Octocat</summary>
  
 * Head on over to the [Octocat Generator](https://myoctocat.com/) and create an Octocat representing your wonderful self.
