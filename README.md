<details>
<summary>Say hello 👋</summary>
  
 * Conferences are always more fun when you run into old friends and connections 👯‍♀️ Scan the list of attendees and send a quick hello to each name you recognize on the list. No names you recognize? We'll be your friend! Say hi to @elisemoe or @juanpflores. Complete this task by checking the box to say you've reconnected with someone at HackCon VIII.

<details>
<summary>Make new friends 👯‍♀️</summary>
  
 * Now that we've done some catching up, let's make a new friend. Choose one name (at random or someone you've wanted to connect with) and introduce yourself. Let them know why you love your student community and ask a question about theirs :) To complete this mission you'll need to send us a screenshot of your intro. No need to include their response!

<summary>Build your alter ego Octocat</summary>
  
 * Head on over to the [Octocat Generator](https://myoctocat.com/) and create an Octocat representing your wonderful self. Tag `@GitHubEducation` and use the hashtag `#HackCon` on Twitter for a chance to be featured! Upload your Octocat to the Issue in order to complete this one.

  <summary>Take a screenshot selfie with a Campus Expert or someone from the GitHub Education team  📸 </summary>
  
 *  Keep at eye on Discord through out the day and we'll let you know when we're hanging out inthe networking section. You can never be sure who you'll meet! When you come accross someone from the team (we'll be wearing our GitHub hoodies), capture a screenshot selfie. Share the selfie (usie?) in the Issue to verify this one.

  <details>
  <summary>Show us your "view" 🖼 </summary>
  
 *  Share a picture of your “view” at the conference. Laptop on the couch? Maybe the weather's nice and you're hanging out outside? Let's see what HackCon looks like in your slice on the universe. Upload a picture to the [Discussion](https://github.com/education/hackconviii/discussions) to verify this mission.

  <summary>Where in the world? 🌍 </summary>
  
 *  Major League Hacking is a global community of hackers and community builders, and we are so excited that this year's HackCon is accessible from anywhere. Share something about your part of the world by taking a picture that represents your culture or location. For example, @elisemoe lives in Seattle so she might share a picture of an umbrella. This mission is verified by adding your image to the `Where in the world 🌍` [Discussion](https://github.com/education/hackconviii/discussions)
